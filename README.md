```
Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

From Bissau to Palau
In the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree
And the Isles of Ebony

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word

I hear your name calling me out

Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

From the North to the South
Ebudae onto Khartoum
From the deep Sea of Clouds
To the Island of the Moon
Carry me on the waves
To the lands I've never been
Carry me on the waves
To the lands I've never seen

We can sail, we can sail
With the Orinoco flow
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away

We can steer, we can near
With Rob Dickins at the wheel
We can sigh, say Goodbye
Ross and his dependency

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

(We can sail, we can sail, sail away, sail away, sail away)
Or else forget about it
(From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon)
Or else forget about it
(We can sail, we can sail, sail away, sail away, sail away)
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Gimme your heart, make it real
Let's don't forget about it, hey
(We can sail, we can sail, sail away, sail away, sail away)
Let's don't forget about it, no oh no oh
(From Peru to Cebu feel the power of Babylon)
Let's don't forget about it, no no no oh
(We can sail, we can sail, sail away, sail away, sail away)
Let's don't forget about it, hey no no oh
(We can sail, we can sail, sail away, sail away, sail away)
Let's don't forget about it, hey hey hey
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
