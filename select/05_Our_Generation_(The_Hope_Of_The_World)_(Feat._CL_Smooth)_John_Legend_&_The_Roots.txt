Hope of the world is in our generation
(Lets straighten it out)
It's all left up to us to change this present situation
(Lets straighten it out)
Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake
(Lets straighten it out)
Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate
Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another
Just look at what happened to the Indian and the brother
Straighten it out
Straighten it out
Straighten it out
Hope of the world is in our generation
(Lets straighten it out)
It's all left up to us to change this present situation
(Lets straighten it out)
Our leaders make us fight, and we don't know what for
(Lets straighten it out)
If they want people killed, let them fight the war
It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease
If no one were to fight, we'd all live in peace
Our generation, it's all left up to us
Our generation, let's do just what we must
Straighten it out, (Straighten it out)
Gotta straighten it out
Straighten it out, (Straighten it out)
We can straighten it out yeah
As long as there's a you, there's a better me
It's why we're together and stronger
Than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless, can health care cover this?
A love for all people no matter what the culture is
Our generation, is makin' huge strides
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see
A fair chance means a greater opportunity
To have a brighter future, deeper insight
Work hard to be anything you want in life
It's what it's all about, the longevity
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find
They can cage your body, but not your mind
We lay it all on the line in the struggle
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do
Our generation, it's all left up to us
(Straighten it out)
Our generation,
