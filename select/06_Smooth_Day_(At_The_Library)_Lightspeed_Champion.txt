Two weeks longer, we're getting older
Likeness meet sometime
Waitin' surely, all night and early
Morning light, sun shines

Please take me home again, my lover
Please take me down again, my lover

Longing always, with my book in place
Never stretchin' time
Reading surely, all night and early
Morning light, sun shines

Please take me home again, my lover
Please take me down again, my lover

You said you don't want to leave me
What else can I do?
You said you don't want to see me
I'll still pursue

Please take me home again, my lover
Please take me down again, my lover
