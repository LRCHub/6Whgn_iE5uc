Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches
from the midday sun
I hear you whisper
and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My munequita
my Spanish Harlem mona lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove now
And if you say this life
ain't good enough I would give
my world to lift you up
I could change my life
to better suit your mood
Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean
under the moon
That's the same emotion
that I get from you
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth
And gimme your heart
make it real
Or else forget about it
<♪>
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave
it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning
of the world so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round
And if you say this life
ain't good enough I would give
my world to lift you up
I could change my life
to better suit your mood
Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean
under the moon
That's the same emotion
that I get from you
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth
And gimme your heart
make it real
Or else forget about it
<♪>
And it's just like the ocean
under the moon
That's the same emotion
that I get from you
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth
And gimme your heart
make it real
Or else forget about it yeah
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it yeah
Let's don't forget about it
Let's don't forget about it
Let's don't forget about it
Let's don't forget about it
