I could give my life to you
If you tell me what you want
I'll do what you want me to
If it's really, really what you want

With just a word you reach to me
I will do all that I can
So much that you can teach me, baby
If you say you'll be my man

Smooth and sweet, I feel your touch
Won't you make this a reality
Smooth and sweet, I want so much
For you to become a part of me
Smooth and sweet, I feel your touch
Can you make this a reality
Smooth and sweet, I want so much
For you to become a part of me

I can move my world right now
If you tell me what you need, hmm
Even turn it upside down
If it's really, really what you need

Hold out your arms and reach to me
I will do all that I can
Now that you know I need you, baby
Won't you say you'll be my man

Smooth and sweet, I feel your touch
Won't you make this a reality
Smooth and sweet, I want so much
For you to become a part of me
Smooth and sweet, I feel your touch
Can you make this a reality
Smooth and sweet, I want so much
For you to become a part of me, oh, oh

Smooth and sweet
So smooth and sweet
So smooth and sweet
So smooth and sweet
Smooth and sweet

Smooth and sweet, I feel your touch
Won't you make this a reality
Smooth and sweet, I want so much
For you to become a part of me
Smooth and sweet, I feel your touch
Can you make this a reality
Smooth and sweet, I want so much
For you to become a part of me

Smooth and sweet
Smooth and sweet, I feel your touch
Do it but I can't
Smooth and sweet, I want so much
For you to become a part of me
